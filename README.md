# ChatApp-server
Prolly the worst code I've ever written but it works. 

You need to have MongoDb setup on your machine if you want to pair this server with the Angular UI. 

## To run the app locally in your system:

Navigate to the project folder in your terminal:

`npm install` would install all the dependencies and 
`nodemon` would start a local development server at http://localhost:3000/.
